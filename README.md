# C# HW Project 

Given portfolio of crypto coins, this program updates profit and loss in each minute. 

- ICoinmarketcapClient was used to update the coin data. It is free version, but still seems to be fine for this purpose.
- I had hard time to extract the data from one of json file. So, I manually provided the input in the script. (usually not a good idea, but had to choose in time pressed case)
